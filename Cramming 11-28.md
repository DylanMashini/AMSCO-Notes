Italian monopolies lead to state sponsered expolrations by Spain, portugal, france, england to find more direct routes to Asia

### Christopher Columbus
Gained support of spanish gov't to explore, discovered new world
Discoveries lead to increased intrest in discovery by English, French, and Dutch. 

### Role of States
Rivalry of states lead to increased subidies for exploration - States belived there was a limited ammount of wealth in the world and were competing for it (States wanted more gold and silver)

#### Portugal in SE and E Asia
Alfonso de Aluquerque won battle with Arab traders and set up shop within Malacca. Initally this expansion didn't impact Chinese culture, but eventually missionaries followed, and Jesuit missionaries failed to get the elite (scholar gentry) class to convert. 

#### Trading Post Empire
To legitimize and maintain control of power portugese constructed ports across asia. The aims were to establish a monopoly over the spice trade (very profitable). Portugese also required licences and other regulations for others to sail indian ocean. 

#### Vulnerability
Portugal lacked population nececary to enforce their rule across their vast empire, and their laws quickly crumbled. Soon, many portugese merchants traded outside of the jurisdiction of the portugese gov't

### Spanish
Portugal was first to establish trade to Asia, but Spanish sailors were first to circumnavigate globe. 

### Motivation
The primary motivation for all the expoloration was Gold and Silver. The spanish considered cancelling their programs of exploration when yields were low.
